                    This application is essentially very simple. When you participate,
                    the platform will load a scanned index card from the British Museum's Bronze Age catalog
                    (stored on the MicroPasts <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> stream).
                    Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked to transcribe the contents of each
                    card. An example card is shown below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each card contains similar information and we are asking you to enter this information into set fields.
                    Inside each field you will find a general indication of where the information that you should enter is
                    located on the card. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object type: found top centre (for example "Palstave")</li>
                    <li>Place of discovery or site found: top left, under heading site</li>
                    <li>The collection it came from: top right</li>
                    <li>References: centre</li>
                    <li>Dimensions &amp; mass: centre left &amp; centre right, comprising of length, width, etc.</li>
                    <li>Composition: centre left</li>
                    <li>Description: centre (sometimes just a single word, repeating object type)</li>
                    <li>Surface and patina: bottom left</li>
                    <li>Associations: centre bottom</li>
                    <li>Remarks: centre bottom</li>
                </ul>

                    Some issues to watch out for:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The "top right corner" field is normally a typological code including letters and Latin numbers in
                    different cases, often but not always written in pencil. An example is shown below:<br />
                    <img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/12233629423_e5f1f6ddcf_o.png"
                         alt="An example of a typological code" width="227" height="65" class="img-polaroid"/></li>
                    <li>When entering information in the fields, please respect the case of words as seen on the card.</li>
                    <li>If you see text that is stacked on several lines or separated by a gap, but otherwise belongs to the
                    same category of information and should go into just one of our pre-specified boxes, then separate
                    it by a semi-colon (;). So for example, in the example we showed you just before, <strong>"British Museum"</strong>
                    and <strong>"Given by Alfred Jones, Pevensey"</strong> were both entries that should be entered in the the Collection
                    box, so you could simply put <strong>"British Museum; Given by Alfred Jones, Pevensey"</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If there is additional information on the card that you donâ€™t feel fits in one of our pre-specified
                    boxes, then please put it in our "Transcriber's Comments" box at the end</li>
                </ol>
