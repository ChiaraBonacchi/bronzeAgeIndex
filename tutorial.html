                    <strong>Hello.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application will help the 
                    <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org" title="The BM website">British Museum</a>'s 
                    curator of the Bronze Age collections, Neil Wilkin, to make available a huge card catalog of 
                    British prehistoric metal artefacts discovered in the 19th and 20th century. 
                    This information has long been known to be an extremely important untapped resource. 
                    Metal finds are not only crucial forms of evidence for dating Britain's prehistoric past, 
                    but also tell us a great deal about prehistoric society and economy. 
                    Digitising the thousands of objects in this catalog will enhance the 
                    British Museum's existing collections database, but more importantly will also 
                    make these records publicly available via their incorporation into the 
                    <a href="http://finds.org.uk" title="PAS website">Portable Antiquities Scheme 
                    website.</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we have combined the information in this catalog with additional finds from 
                    the PAS, both academic researchers and the public will have access to the largest 
                    national database of prehistoric metal finds anywhere in the world and a near 
                    comprehensive view of what we currently know about such finds in the UK.

                    The application is essentially very simple. When you participate,
                    the platform will load a scanned image from the Bronze Age archive
                    (stored on the MicroPasts <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> stream).
                    Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked to transcribe the contents of each
                    card. An example of a card is shown below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each card contains similar information and we are asking you to enter this information into set fields.
                    Inside each field you will find a general indication of where the information that you should enter is 
                    located on the card. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object type: found top centre (for example "Palstave")</li>
                    <li>Place of discovery or site found: top left, under heading site</li>
                    <li>The collection it came from: top right</li>
                    <li>References: centre</li>
                    <li>Dimensions &amp; mass: centre left &amp; centre right, comprising of length, width, etc.</li>
                    <li>Composition: centre left</li>
                    <li>Description: centre (sometimes just a single word, repeating object type)</li>
                    <li>Surface and patin: bottom left</li>
                    <li>Associations: centre bottom</li>
                    <li>Remarks: centre bottom</li>
                </ul>

                    Some issues to watch out for:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The "top right corner" field is normally a typological code including letters and Latin numbers in 
                    different cases, often but not always written in pencil. An example is shown below:<br />
                    <img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/12233629423_e5f1f6ddcf_o.png" /></li>
                    <li>When entering information in the fields, please respect the case of words as seen on the card.</li>
                    <li>If you see text that is stacked on several lines or separated by a gap, but otherwise belongs to the 
                    same category of information and should go into just one of our pre-specified boxes, then separate 
                    it by a semi-colon (;). So for example, in the example we showed you just before, "British Museum" 
                    and "Given by Alfred Jones, Pevensey" were both entries that should be entered in the the Collection 
                    box, so you could simply put "British Museum; Given by Alfred Jones, Pevensey".</li>
                    <li>If there is additional information on the card that you donâ€™t feel fits in one of our pre-specified 
                    boxes, then please put it in our "Other Remarks" box at the end</li>
                </ol>
