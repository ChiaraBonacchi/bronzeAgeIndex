        This British Museum's Bronze Age Index application, is aimed at helping
        the curator of Bronze Age collections catalogue a corpus of around 30,000
        index cards. These cards have been collated at the British Museum for over
        50 years and contain an untapped resource.
        </p>
        <p>
        The cards have been scanned and uploaded to Flickr, so that its API can be
        used to retrieve and manipulate the scans. These cards hold relatively
        standardised data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Front: Place of discovery, dimensions, description etc</li>
            <li>Reverse: A line drawing of the object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        What the research team would like people to do, is to transcribe these cards
        and enter the details from each of these into pre-determined fields and
        attempt to geo-reference the object via the place of discovery.
        By doing this, these cards can complement the data already entered into
        the British Museum collections management system (Merlin), but can also be
        uploaded to the Portable Antiquities Scheme database.
